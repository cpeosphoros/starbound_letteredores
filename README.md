# LetteredOres

I found it difficult to recognize the differences between various ores. Worst offenders were Platinum vs Silver vs Titanium, and Gold vs Solarium. Although I'm not colorblind, I guess players who are will have an even harder time to distinguish various ores.

So I added a small letter colored like the ore itself above each ore type, to make them better recognizable.
